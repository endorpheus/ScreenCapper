# ScreenCapper

Here we have *yet another* screencap tool.  Initially, it was just going to be a basic "grab the whole screen" type of thing, but it was fun, so I just kept going.  
  
## A Powerful Screenshot Tool for Linux üòÅ

**ScreenCapper** was written in Python. Sitting in your system tray like a beloved pet, it empowers you to capture specific areas of your screen and save them as images. Woof!

### Features

* Capture full screenshots or select smaller regions for precise capturing.
* System tray icon for easy access without cluttering your desktop.
* Audio cues for capture and successful/failed saves to provide feedback.
* The tool remembers the last directory used for image saving, defaulting to your ~/Pictures directory.

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
