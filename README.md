# ScreenCapper

Here we have **yet another** screencap tool.  Initially it was just going to be a basic "grab the whole screen" type of thing, but it was fun, so I just kept going.  The interface is a mess, and there is random weirdness with it, but I'll keep at it.  For now, until I get around to patching up a few things, it runs just fine in the tray just click, select a region, save and that's it. Very quick and easy.  This **README** is a *placeholder* until I get time to flesh it out.  *Thanks for dropping by.*  I'll see you soon enough.

Oh yea, before I forget, There's an error I forgot to fix before I uploaded this version.  It can be reproduced by trying to save an image without giving it an extension. It's an easy fix. I'll squash it in a day or two:<br><br>
